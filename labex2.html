        <h2>C PROGRAMMING</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs.
                </li>
            <li>It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.</li>
        </ul>  
        <hr>
        <h2>PYTHON</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. </li>
            <li> Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</li>
       </ol>
       <hr>
       <h2>C++</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>C++ (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages.
                </li>
            <li>It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system resources.</li>
       </ol>
       <HR>
       <h2>JAVA</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</li>
            <li> It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),</li></li>
       </ol>
