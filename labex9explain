This is a basic HTML code for a responsive website built using Bootstrap. The code starts with a navbar that has links to different pages on the website. The `container` class provides a container for the website content. The page also features a `jumbotron` section containing a welcome message and a call-to-action button. Below the `jumbotron` section are three `card` elements that show some sample content of the website's services. Bootstrap classes and library links are utilized to provide responsive web design and other interactive features, such as toggling the navbar on smaller screens.
